I am a research data scientist at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/) and an adjunct lecturer at [Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia](https://uai.ac.id/) (currently on leave). Starting from September 2021, I'm taking a part-time PhD programme in Statistical Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) mainly supervised by [Dr Takoua Jendoubi](https://takouajendoubi.github.io/) and [Dr Alejandro Díaz](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=FADIA90). Prior to that, I was a data scientist at [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/), [HappyFresh](https://www.happyfresh.com/), [eFishery](https://efishery.com/), and [Airy](https://www.airyrooms.com/). My research interests are in machine learning for healthcare and social data science. I obtained an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in 2016 and a BSc in Informatics from [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/) in 2013.

I am open for research collaboration and consultation in machine learning. E-mail me at **pm[at]aliakbars[dot]id**.
