I am currently a senior data scientist at Revolut. I am also pursuing a part-time PhD in Statistical Science at University College London, working under the supervision of [Dr. Takoua Jendoubi](https://takouajendoubi.github.io/) and [Dr. Alejandro DÃ­az](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/72757). In the past, I have worked as a data scientist at companies such as [Nokia Bell Labs](https://social-dynamics.net/), [HappyFresh](https://www.happyfresh.com/), [eFishery](https://efishery.com/), and [Airy](https://www.airyrooms.com/). My research interests lie in using machine learning for healthcare and social data science. I received my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 2016 and my BSc in Informatics from Institut Teknologi Bandung in 2013.

I am open for research collaboration and consultation in machine learning. E-mail me at **pm[at]aliakbars[dot]id**.
