I am a data science consultant at [HappyFresh](https://www.happyfresh.id/) and an adjunct lecturer at [Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia](https://uai.ac.id/). Prior to that, I was a lead data scientist at [Airy](https://www.airyrooms.com/) and a senior data scientist at [eFishery](https://efishery.com/). My research interests are in machine learning for healthcare and social data science. I obtained an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in 2016 and BSc in Informatics from [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/) in 2013.

I am open for research collaboration and consultation in machine learning. E-mail me at **pm[at]aliakbars[dot]id**.
